# Women-Who-Code-2024-Python
WWCode Python 60 day challenge

Women Who Code (WWCode) runs a Days of Code event each year during which participants commit to code for a certain number of consecutive days. There are sub-groups who commit to more specific tasks such as the WWCode Python group. Participants receive a challenge every day for 60 days. Here you will find my solution to each challenge.
